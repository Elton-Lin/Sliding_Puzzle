Sliding Puzzle

Functionality:
- User input image (or just number mode)
- User input size of puzzle (2x2 to mxn)
- Generate puzzle with cropped image

- In game options
    - Arrow keys to slide the block
    - Side bar
        - Moves counter
        - Reshuffle
        - Restart
        - 



Implementation:
- Image processing


- Grid (independent from image?)
    - 2D list of integers represent order
    - Separation between blocks
        - Static thin black lines on grid (make img/block smaller with margin or just overlay the lines)
        - boarder around each image block

- Puzzle game
    - forms the logic of the game
        - shuffle the blocks
        - enable movement/ animation
        - end when order is resumed

image[][]: img object
0 1 2
3 4 5
6 7 8


grid[][]: int
0 1 2
3 4 5
6 7 *

use grid for arrangement of blocks
display according to grid elements (correspond to each img object)

e.g. move 5 down (swap 5 and *)
grid[][]: int
0 1 2
3 4 *
6 7 5
now it displays by walking thru grid to show img object in that order



each move is a swap with empty(*)
