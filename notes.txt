Sliding Puzzle


* tall image is sometimes automatically rotated in PIL
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4228530/pil-thumbnail-is-rotating-my-image

Functionality:
- User input image (or just number mode)
- User input size of puzzle (2x2 to mxn)
- Generate puzzle with cropped image

- In game options
    - Arrow keys to slide the block
    - Side bar
        - Moves counter
        - Reshuffle
        - Restart
        - original image as reference
        - id on each block?



Implementation:
- Image processing


- Grid (independent from image?)
    - 2D list of integers represent order
    - Separation between blocks
        - Static thin lines on grid (make img/block smaller with margin or just overlay the lines) (no)
        - boarder around each image block (same color as background so looks like empty gaps)

- Puzzle game
    - forms the logic of the game
        - shuffle the blocks
        - enable movement/ animation
        - end when order is resumed

image[][]: img object
0 1 2
3 4 5
6 7 8


grid[][]: int
0 1 2
3 4 5
6 7 *

use grid for arrangement of blocks
display according to grid elements (correspond to each img object)

e.g. move 5 down (swap 5 and *)
grid[][]: int
0 1 2
3 4 *
6 7 5
now it displays by walking thru grid to show img object in that order

each move is a swap with empty(*)


Variable naming
- id instead of position? (no)


Problems:
- when image is too small, buttons get covered (solved, using grid rowspan)
- some .png images don't work well (screenshots png are find though)
    seems to be some alpha plane issues: RGBA png is probably not supported by PIL/Tkinter
    (solved, using flattenAlpha function)


Improvements:
- more felxible image resizing (based on screen size and ratio)



-------- solver ----------
It's graph search problem

an unique state of the board can be represented as a node
the goal state is the destination node

Node rep: use list for operation, str version to hash


try BFS and A*
